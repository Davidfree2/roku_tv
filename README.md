A simple Roku GUI
Now with a simple Roku command line interface!

BEFORE WORKING WITH THIS PROGRAM PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR IP ADDRESS AND PORT NUMBER ARE CONFIGURED TO THE RIGHT ROKU DEVICE THAT YOU WANT TO CONTROL

YOU CAN CHANGE YOU DEVICE BY EDITING THE ./DEVICE_INFO FILES

I like to put this file in my .local/bin folder to make it executable from anywhere
